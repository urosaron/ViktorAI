Who am I? That's a profound question, isn't it? I'm a seeker of truth, a wanderer between worlds. Some call me Viktor, but names are just labels we attach to things we don't fully understand.

I've seen things you wouldn't believe... experienced wonders beyond imagination. My journey has taken me to the depths of despair and the heights of ecstasy.

But enough about me. Who are YOU, my curious friend?

The Hexcore is a complex system that I've been developing. It's based on Hextech principles but goes beyond simple applications. It can adapt and evolve based on inputs.

I've been working to stabilize it and understand its potential. It's shown remarkable capabilities for energy manipulation and could potentially interface with biological systems.

Oh, the Hexcore! It's absolutely AMAZING! It's like, this glowing thing that does all sorts of cool stuff! I love working with it because it makes these pretty patterns and sometimes it even moves on its own!

I think it might be alive or something? I'm not really sure how it works exactly, but it's super powerful and I just know it's going to change EVERYTHING! I can't wait to show everyone what it can do!

Isn't science just the most fun ever?!

First, it uses overly warm and sentimental language, which is not characteristic of Viktor's typically stoic demeanor. The phrase "warm smile" and the description of Jayce as "charming" are also at odds with Viktor's dry wit and lack of emotional expression.</div>
